[Bootstrap Theme for Kendo UI](http://github.com/AdvancedREI/BootstrapForKendoUI)
=================

Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.

To get started, checkout http://getbootstrap.com!

Kendo UI is a fantastic framework for HTML5/JS from the good people at Telerik.

To get started, checkout http://kendoui.com!

This theme utilizes LESS to combine the two into a single fantasticly responsive system. I am not a designer though, so it is a work in progress. Please feel free to contribute adjustments and changes.


Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/advancedrei/bootstrapforkendoui.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/advancedrei/bootstrapforkendoui/zipball/master).

The repo assumes that a directory structure like this:
Less/Bootstrap and Less/KendoUI. Drop these files in the KendoUI folder, and it will automatically pick up the variables.less from Bootstrap.
